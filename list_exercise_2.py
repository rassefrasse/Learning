#my second list exercise. I created a list with the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.
#to initiate the list or the program, i stated by saying that sum_numbers value is 0
#but, with a for loop, saying that for each number in the list called numbers, add a number onto the variable sum_numbers
#and then the program prints the sum_numbers, aka, the sum of all of my numbers.
