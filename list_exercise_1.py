colors = ["blue", "purple", "yellow"]
for color in colors:
    print("i like", color)

#This is the first exercise I did with lists. I created a list containing three different colors.
#Combined with the list, i made a for loop. The program will loop all of the colors inside the list together with the print "i like"
