for num in range(1, 11):
    square = num * num
    print("your number: ", num, " square:", square) 


#this is a for loop.

#basically how i translate it is "for each number in the range of 1-11". but yeah, no the's etc. range(between 1, 11)
#and then to take it one step further, to calculate the square of each number. the square is num*num and thus...

#the program prints out your number in the range of 1, 11 and its square as dictated by the square variable
